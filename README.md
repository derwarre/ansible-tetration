## Session
This repository is a companion to the network breakout session, *Using Ansible Tower to implement security policies and telemetry streaming for hybrid clouds*. 

The focus of the session illustrates using Ansible to facilitate installation of the software sensor on Linux hosts, how Cisco Tetration can be used as a dynamic inventory source for Ansible Playbooks and how policy generated from Tetration Application Dependency Mapping (ADM) can be used to apply policy to a Cisco ACI fabric and other network devices.
