## Network Policy Publisher 
The Tetration Network Policy Publisher uses a Kafka message broker for publishing network policy, which are seralized using Google ProtoBuffers.

### Kafka Python

The Kafka Python package was selected rather than the Confluent Kafka package. Confluent does not provide a means to disable certification checking. The Tetration cluster installed in the Advanced Technology Center (ATC) uses a self-signed certificate. In order to authenticate and bypass the certificate checking, the program creates an SSL context with CERT_NONE, no certificates from the server are required (or looked at if provided)) and provide the context to Kafka Python.

The Kafka Python [documentation](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/kafka-python/master/kafka-python.pdf) is used as reference.

The KafaConsumer method requires Snappy for decompression. Python-snappy requires the Snappy C library. Installing `libsnappy-dev`, `kafka-python`, and `python-snappy` is required to execute the program.

### Protocol Buffers
The Tetration Kafka broker transports the Network Policy as a Google Protocol Buffer. To use Protocol Buffers in Python, you need three things:

* Tetration .proto definition file
* Python Protocol Buffer library
* Protocol buffer compiler

The .proto definition file `tetration_network_policy.proto` is used by the compiler to generate a Python file `tetration_network_policy_pb2.py` and imported by the program

#### Definition file
Source code for the TetrationNetworkPolicyProto definition file is available from the Tetration appliance GUI, or can be downloaded from the tetration-exchange repo:

https://github.com/tetration-exchange/pol-client-java/blob/master/proto/network_enforcement/tetration_network_policy.proto

This definition file is compiled by the protocol buffer compiler. The output generated is comprised of Python classes and methods to decode the policy generated by Tetration.

#### Python Library

Refer to the Google Python tutorial, at  [https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial]), download the Python library.
```

~/protobufs$ wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.6.1/protobuf-python-3.6.1.tar.gz
~/protobufs$ gunzip protobuf-python-3.6.1.tar.gz
```
The program imports `tetration_network_policy_pb2`, PYTHONPATH must reference the directories of the Python library and the compiled protocol buffer.
```
~/protobufs/protobuf-3.6.1/python
~ tetration/ansible-tetration/library
```
_TODO_ Update the program and this section to gracefully reference the necessary directory structure and PYTHONPATH when running under Ansible Tower.

#### Compiler Install instructions for Protocobuf3

Install the precompiled binary version of the protocol buffer compiler (protoc).

These [instructions](https://gist.github.com/rvegas/e312cb81bbb0b22285bc6238216b709b) are a useful reference.

Download and unzip the [file](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.6.1/protoc-3.6.1-linux-x86_64.zip). Given a work directory at `~/protobufs` . 

```
~/protobufs$ wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.6.1/protoc-3.6.1-linux-x86_64.zip
~/protobufs$ unzip protoc-3.6.1-linux-x86_64.zip -d protoc3
```
###### Move protoc to /usr/local/bin/
```
sudo mv protoc3/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
```
###### Move protoc3/include to /usr/local/include/
```
sudo mv protoc3/include/* /usr/local/include/
```
The only file remaining in `~/protobufs/protoc3` is the readme.txt. The work directory can be removed if desired.

###### Optional: change owner
```
sudo chown $USER /usr/local/bin/protoc
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/include/google
```
###### Verify the version
```
~/protobufs$ which protoc
/usr/local/bin/protoc
administrator@flint:~/protobufs$ protoc --version
libprotoc 3.6.1
```

#### Compile the .proto file
The Google tutorial syntax for compilation of the .proto file is:
```
protoc -I=$SRC_DIR --python_out=$DST_DIR $SRC_DIR/addressbook.proto
```
Assuming the .proto file is `/files/tetration_network_policy.proto`, write the output to the same directory as the source code `/library/`, invoke the compiler:
```
protoc -I=/ansible-tetration/files/ --python_out=/ansible-tetration/library/ /ansible-tetration/files/tetration_network_policy.proto
```
View, but do not edit, the output file.

#### Ansible Configuration file

The Ansible configuration file, `ansible.cfg` should specify a location to look for the `tetration_network_policy.py` module and the protocol buffer module, `tetration_network_policy_pb2.py`.

Modify the `ansible.cfg` file to include:
```
library        = /usr/share/ansible/
module_utils   = /usr/share/ansible/module_utils/
```
and copy (or move) `tetration_network_policy.py` to the directory specified as the `library` and  `tetration_network_policy_pb2.py` to the directory specified by the `module_utils`.

#### Print help

You can use the interactive Python interpreter to print the help from the compiled .proto file:

```python
import tetration_network_policy_pb2

import pydoc
help = pydoc.render_doc(tetration_network_policy_pb2, "Help on %s")
f = open("/tmp/tetration_network_policy_pb2.txt", 'w+')
print >>f, help
f.close()
quit()
```
Review the output file.
```bash
cat /tmp/tetration_network_policy_pb2.txt
```

### Authenticating with the Kafka Broker

### Tips for using the protocol buffer methods
Few tutorials exist on using Python and protocol buffers, here are some notes:

Review the `.proto` file, for example:

```
// CatchAll policy action.
message CatchAllPolicy {
  enum Action {
    INVALID = 0;
    // Allow the corresponding flows.
    ALLOW = 1;
    // DROP the corresponding flows.
    DROP = 2;
  };
  Action action = 1;
}
```
Derive a meaningful name to the value of catch_all.action with:

```python
import tetration_network_policy_pb2 

    ### assume the buffer is stored in policy.buffer 
    tnp = policy.buffer.tenant_network_policy
    for item in tnp.network_policy:
        print ('catch_all', tetration_network_policy_pb2.CatchAllPolicy.Action.Name(item.catch_all.action))

('catch_all', 'ALLOW')        
```
IPAddressFamily example:
```
enum IPAddressFamily {
  INVALID = 0;
  IPv4 = 1;
  IPv6 = 2;
};
```
Use the Name method to decode the values provided.
```
>>> import tetration_network_policy_pb2 as tnp
>>> tnp.IPAddressFamily.Name(0)
'INVALID'
>>> tnp.IPAddressFamily.Name(1)
'IPv4'
>>> tnp.IPAddressFamily.Name(2)
'IPv6'
>>> try:
...     tnp.IPAddressFamily.Name(3)
... except ValueError as e:
...     print e
...
Enum IPAddressFamily has no name defined for value 3
>>>
```
